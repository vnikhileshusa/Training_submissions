Database & Tables —
A database is like a digital filing cabinet, and tables are like individual folders that hold information in rows (records) and columns (fields).

Queries —
A query is simply a question or command you ask the database. You write it in SQL to get or change data.

Main SQL Commands (CRUD) —

SELECT → used to read or retrieve data.

INSERT → used to add new data.

UPDATE → used to modify existing data.

DELETE → used to remove data.

Filtering and Sorting —
Use WHERE to filter results, ORDER BY to sort them, and LIMIT to control how many results you see.

Joins —
Joins let you combine data from multiple tables based on shared columns (like connecting customers to their orders).

Constraints and Keys —

Primary Key: uniquely identifies each record in a table.

Foreign Key: connects one table to another.

Constraints: rules that ensure data is accurate (like not allowing empty names).

Data Types —
Each column has a type (text, number, date, etc.) defining what kind of data it can hold.
